I WAS 13 WHEN I FIRST GOT ACCESS TO A COMPUTER 
2
 MY PARENTS 
3
BOUGHT ME A MACINTOSH IN 1984 WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD 
4
 I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE 
5
 I LEARNED TO CODE IN COLLEGE 
6
 FRESHMAN YEAR FIRST SEMESTER INTRO TO COMPUTER SCIENCE 
7
 I WROTE A PROGRAM TO  PLAY TIC TAC TOE 
8
 I THINK IT WAS PRETTY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS 
9
I THINK THE FIRST PROGRAM I WROTE ASKED THINGS LIKE WHATS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR 
10
OR HOW OLD ARE YOU 
11
 I FIRST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A GREEN CIRCLE AND 
12
A RED SQUARE APPEAR ON THE SCREEN 
13
 THE FIRST TIME I ACTUALLY HAD SOMETHING COME UP AND 
14
SAY HELLO WORLD I MADE A COMPUTER DO THAT IT WAS JUST ASTONISHING 
15
 LEARNING HOW TO PROGRAM DIDNT START OFF AS WANTING TO 
16
 LEARN ALL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OR 
17
TRYING TO MASTER THIS DISCIPLINE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
18
I JUST STARTED OFF BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO THIS ONE SIMPLE THING 
19
I WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS FUN FOR MYSELF AND MY SISTERS 
20
AND I WROTE THIS LITTLE PROGRAM THEN BASICALLY JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT TO IT 
21
AND WHEN I NEEDED TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW I LOOKED IT UP 
22
EITHER IN A BOOK OR ON THE INTERNET AND THEN ADDED A LITTLE BIT TO IT 
23
 ITS REALLY NOT UNLIKE PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT OR 
24
SOMETHING OR  OR PLAYING A SPORT

26
 IT STARTS BEING VERY INTIMIDATING BUT YOU KINDA GET THE HANG OF IT OVER TIME 
27
 CODING IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE LEARNED 
28
AND I KNOW IT CAN BE INTIMIDATING AND A LOT OF THINGS ARE INTIMIDATING 
29
BUT WHAT ISNT 
30
 A LOT OF THE CODING THAT PEOPLE DO IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE 
31
ITS MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN PROBLEMS THEN YOU KNOW SORT OF 
32
COMING UP WITH COMPLICATED ALGORITHMS AS PEOPLE TRADITIONALLY THINK ABOUT IT 
33
 YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A GENIUS TO KNOW HOW TO CODE 
34
YOU NEED TO BE DETERMINED 
35
 ADDITION SUBTRACTION THATS ABOUT IT 
36
 YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW YOUR MULTIPLICATION TABLES 
37
 YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A GENIUS TO CODE 
38
DO YOU HAVE TO BE A GENIUS TO READ 
39
 EVEN IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A RACE CAR DRIVER OR PLAY BASEBALL OR YOU KNOW 
40
BUILD A HOUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY SOFTWARE 
41
 WHAT IT IS IS YOU KNOW COMPUTERS ARE EVERYWHERE 
42
YOU WANT TO WORK IN AGRICULTURE 
43
DO YOU WANT TO WORK IN ENTERTAINMENT 
44
DO YOU WANT TO WORK IN MANUFACTURING ITS JUST ALL OVER 
45
[MUSIC] 
46
 HERE WE ARE IN 2013 
47
WE ALL DEPEND ON TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE TO BANK INFORMATION 
48
AND NONE OF US KNOW HOW TO READ AND WRITE CODE 
49
 WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WAS IN THIS AFTER SCHOOL GROUP CALLED THE WHIZ KIDS 
50
AND WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT THEY LAUGHED AT ME AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS 
51
AND IM LIKE MAN I DONT CARE 
52
I THINK ITS COOL AND IM LEARNING A LOT AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS HAVE JOBS 
53
[MUSIC] 
54
 OUR POLICY IS LITERALLY TO HIRE AS MANY TALENTED ENGINEERS AS WE CAN FIND 
55
THE WHOLE LIMIT IN THE SYSTEM IS JUST THAT THERE JUST ARENT ENOUGH 
56

57
 TO GET THE VERY BEST PEOPLE WE TRY TO MAKE THE OFFICE AS AWESOME AS POSSIBLE 
58

65
THERES ALL THESE KIND OF INTERESTING THINGS AROUND THE OFFICE AND 
66
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN PLAY OR RELAX OR GO TO THINK OR PLAY MUSIC OR BE CREATIVE 
67
[MUSIC] 
68
WHETHER YOURE TRYING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR WHETHER YOU JUST WANNA CHANGE 
69
THE WORLD COMPUTER PROGRAMMING IS AN INCREDIBLY EMPOWERING SKILL TO LEARN 
70
 I THINK IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME THAT 
71
SOFTWARE IS REALLY ABOUT  HUMANITY THAT ITS REALLY ABOUT HELPING 
72
PEOPLE BY USING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IT WOULDVE CHANGED MY OUTLOOK A LOT EARLIER 
73
 TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH AN IDEA AND THEN SEE IT IN YOUR HANDS AND 
74
THEN BE ABLE TO PRESS A BUTTON AND HAVE BEEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLES HANDS 
75
I MEAN I THINK WERE THE  FIRST GENERATION IN THE WORLD THATS 
76
REALLY EVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE 
77
 JUST TO THINK THAT YOU CAN START SOMETHING IN YOUR COLLEGE DORM ROOM AND 
78
YOU CAN HAVE A SET OF PEOPLE WHO HAVENT BUILT A BIG COMPANY BEFORE COME TOGETHER 
79
AND BUILD SOMETHING THAT A BILLION PEOPLE USE AS PART 
80
OF THEIR DAILY LIVES [LAUGH] IS JUST CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT 
81
ITS REALLY HUMBLING AND ITS AMAZING 
82
THE PROGRAMMERS OF TOMORROW ARE THE WIZARDS OF THE FUTURE 
83
YOU KNOW YOURE GONNA LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE MAGIC POWERS COMPARED TO EVERYBODY ELSE 
84
 ITS AMAZING 
85
I THINK ITS THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO A SUPERPOWER 
86
 GREAT CODERS ARE TODAYS ROCK STARS 
87
THATS IT
