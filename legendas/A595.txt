 KHAN ACADEMY IS MOST KNOWN FOR 
3
ITS COLLECTION OF VIDEOS 
4
SO BEFORE I GO ANY FATHER LET ME SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A MONTAGE 
5
SO THE HYPOTENUSE IS NOW GOING TO BE 5 
6
THIS ANIMALS FOSSILS ARE ONLY FOUND IN THIS AREA OF SOUTH AMERICA 
7
A NICE CLEAN BAND HERE AND THIS PART OF AFRICA 
8
WE COULD INTEGRATE OVER THE SURFACE AND THE NOTATION USUALLY IS A CAPITAL SIGMA 
9
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THEY CREATE THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
10
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A VERY NICE COMMITTEE 
11
NOTICE THIS IS AN ALDEHYDE AND ITS AN ALCOHOL 
12
START DIFFERENTIATING INTO EFFECTOR AND MEMORY CELLS 
13
A GALAXY HEY THERES ANOTHER GALAXY 
14
OH LOOK THERES ANOTHER GALAXY 
15
AND FOR DOLLARS IS THEIR 30 MILLION PLUS 
16
THE $20 MILLION FROM THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURER 
17
IF THIS DOES NOT BLOW YOUR MIND THEN YOU HAVE NO EMOTION 
18
[APPLAUSE] WE NOW HAVE ON THE ORDER OF 2200 VIDEOS COVERING 
19
EVERYTHING FROM BASIC ARITHMETIC ALL THE WAY TO VECTOR CALCULUS AND 
20
SOME OF THE STUFF THAT YOU SAW UP THERE 
21
WE HAVE A MILLION STUDENTS A MONTH USING THE SITE 
22
WATCHING ON THE ORDER OF 100 TO 200,000 VIDEOS A DAY 
23
BUT WHAT WERE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN THIS IS HOW WERE GOING TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
24
BUT BEFORE I DO THAT 
25
I WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REALLY JUST HOW I GOT STARTED 
26
SOME OF YOU ALL MIGHT NOW 
27
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS AN ANALYST AT A HEDGE FUND 
28
AND I WAS IN BOSTON AND I WAS TUTORING MY COUSINS IN NEW ORLEANS REMOTELY 
29
AND I STARTED PUTTING THE FIRST YOUTUBE VIDEOS UP 
30
REALLY JUST AS KIND OF A NICE TO HAVE JUST KIND OF A SUPPLEMENT FOR MY COUSINS 
31
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT GIVE THEM A REFRESHER OR SOMETHING 
32
AND AS SOON AS I PUT THOSE FIRST YOUTUBE VIDEOS UP SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED 
33
ACTUALLY A BUNCH OF INTERESTING THINGS HAPPENED 
34
THE FIRST WAS THE FEEDBACK FROM MY COUSINS 
35
THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY PREFERRED ME ON YOUTUBE THAN IN PERSON 
36
 [LAUGH] 
37
 AND ONCE YOU GET OVER THE BACKHANDED 
38
NATURE OF THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING VERY PROFOUND THERE 
39
THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY PREFERRED THE AUTOMATED VERSION OF THEIR COUSIN 
40
TO THEIR COUSIN 
41
AT FIRST ITS VERY UNINTUITIVE BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT FROM THEIR 
42
POINT OF VIEW IT MAKES A TON OF SENSE 
43
YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION WHERE NOW THEY CAN PAUSE AND REPEAT THEIR COUSIN 
44
NOW THEY CAN WITHOUT FEELING LIKE THEYRE WASTING MY TIME THEY COULD IF THEY HAVE 
45
TO REVIEW SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE LEARNED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OR 
46
MAYBE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY DONT HAVE TO BE EMBARRASSED AND 
47
ASK THEIR COUSIN THEY CAN JUST WATCH THOSE VIDEOS 
48
IF THEYRE BORED THEY CAN GO AHEAD THEY CAN WATCH IT AT THEIR OWN TIME 
49
AT THEIR OWN PACE 
50
AND PROBABLY THE LEAST APPRECIATED I GUESS 
51
ASPECT OF THIS IS THE NOTION THAT THE VERY FIRST TIME 
52
THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT YOURE TRYING TO GET YOUR BRAIN AROUND A NEW CONCEPT 
53
THE VERY LAST THING YOU NEED IS A ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SAYING 
54
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS 
55
AND THAT WHATS HAPPENING WITH THE INTERACTION WITH MY COUSINS BEFORE AND 
56
NOW THEY CAN JUST DO IT KIND OF IN THE INTIMACY OF THEIR OWN ROOM 
57
THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED IS I PUT IT ON YOUTUBE JUST FOR 
58
YOU KNOW I SAW NO REASON TO MAKE IT PRIVATE SO I LET OTHER PEOPLE WATCH IT 
59
AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED STUMBLING ON IT 
60
AND I STARTED GETTING SOME COMMENTS AND SOME LETTERS AND 
61
ALL SORTS OF KIND OF FEEDBACK FROM RANDOM PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
62
AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW 
63
THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CALCULUS VIDEOS 
64
AND SOMEONE WROTE JUST ON YOUTUBE IT WAS A YOUTUBE COMMENT 
65
FIRST TIME I SMILED AT DOING A DERIVATIVE 
66
 [LAUGH]  LETS PAUSE HERE 
67
THIS PERSON DID A DERIVATIVE AND THEN THEY SMILED 
68
 [LAUGH]  AND 
69
THEN IN RESPONSE TO THAT SAME COMMENT THIS WAS ON THE THREAD 
70
YOU CAN GO ON YOUTUBE AND LOOK AT THESE COMMENTS SOMEONE ELSE WROTE 
71
SAME THING HERE 
72
I ACTUALLY GOT A NATURAL HIGH AND A GOOD MOOD FOR THE ENTIRE DAY 
73
SINCE I REMEMBER SEEING ALL OF THIS MATRIX TEXT IN CLASS AND 
74
HERE IM ALL LIKE I KNOW KUNG FU 
75
 [LAUGH]  [LAUGH] 
76
AND WE GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK ALONG THOSE 
77
LINES 
78
IT CLEARLY WAS HELPING PEOPLE 
79
BUT THEN AS THE VIEWERSHIP KEPT GROWING AND 
80
KEPT GROWING I STARTED GETTING LETTERS FROM PEOPLE AND IT WAS 
81
STARTING TO BECOME CLEAR THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE THAN JUST A NICE TO HAVE 
82
THIS IS JUST AN EXCERPT FROM ONE OF THOSE LETTERS 
83
MY 12 YEAR OLD SON HAS AUTISM AND HAS HAD A TERRIBLE TIME WITH MATH 
84
WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING VIEWED EVERYTHING BOUGHT EVERYTHING 
85
WE STUMBLED ON YOUR VIDEO ON DECIMALS AND I GOT THROUGH 
86
THEN WE WENT ON TO THE DREADED FRACTIONS AGAIN HE GOT IT 
87
WE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT 
88
HE IS SO EXCITED 
89
AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HERE I WAS 
90
AN ANALYST THAT IT WAS VERY STRANGE FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING A SOCIAL VALUE 
91
[LAUGH] I WAS 
92
[APPLAUSE] BUT I WAS EXCITED SO I KEPT GOING 
93
AND THEN A FEW OTHER THINGS STARTED TO DAWN ON ME 
94
THAT NOT ONLY WOLD IT HELP MY COUSINS RIGHT NOW OR 
95
THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE SENDING LETTERS BUT IT COULD MAYBE THAT THIS CONTENT WILL 
96
NEVER GO OLD THAT IT COULD HELP THEIR KIDS OR THEIR GRAND KIDS 
97
IF ISAAC NEWTON HAD DONE YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON CALCULUS I WOULDNT HAVE TO 
98
[LAUGH] ASSUMING HE WAS GOOD 
99
WE DONT KNOW 
100
[LAUGH] [LAUGH] THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED 
101
AND EVEN AT THIS POINT I SAID OKAY MAYBE ITS A GOOD SUPPLEMENT 
102
ITS GOOD FOR MOTIVATED STUDENTS 
103
ITS GOOD FOR MAYBE HOME SCHOOLERS 
104
BUT I DIDNT THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD SOMEHOW PENETRATE 
105
THE CLASSROOM 
106
BUT THEN I STARTED GETTING LETTERS FROM TEACHERS 
107
AND THE TEACHERS WOULD WRITE SAYING WEVE USED YOUR VIDEOS TO FLIP THE CLASSROOM 
108
YOUVE GIVEN THE LECTURES 
109
SO NOW WHAT WE DO AND THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN EVERY CLASSROOM IN AMERICA 
110
TOMORROW WHAT I DO IS I ASSIGN THE LECTURES FOR HOMEWORK AND 
111
WHAT USED TO BE HOMEWORK I NOW HAVE STUDENTS DOING IN THE CLASSROOM 
112
AND I WANNA PAUSE HERE FOR 
113
[APPLAUSE] I WANT TO PAUSE HERE FOR 
114
A SECOND BECAUSE THERES A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS 
115
ONE WHEN THOSE TEACHERS ARE DOING THAT THERES THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT 
116
THERES THE BENEFIT THAT NOW THEIR STUDENTS 
117
CAN ENJOY THE VIDEOS IN THE WAY THAT MY COUSINS DID 
118
THEY CAN PAUSE REPEAT AT THEIR OWN PACE AT THEIR OWN TIME 
119
BUT THE MORE INTERESTING THING AND 
120
THIS IS THE UNINTUITIVE THING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM 
121
BY REMOVING THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL LECTURE FROM THE CLASSROOM 
122
AND LETTING STUDENTS HAVE A SELF-PACED LECTURE AT HOME 
123
AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE CLASSROOM LETTING THEM DO WORK 
124
HAVING THE TEACHER WALK AROUND 
125
HAVING THE PEERS ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER 
126
THESE TEACHERS HAVE USED TECHNOLOGY TO HUMANIZE THE CLASSROOM 
127
THEY TOOK A FUNDAMENTALLY DEHUMANIZING EXPERIENCE A BUNCH OF 
128
30 KIDS WITH THEIR FINGERS ON LIPS NOT ALLOWED TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER 
129
A TEACHER NO MATTER HOW GOOD 
130
HAS TO GIVE THIS KIND OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL LECTURE TO 30 STUDENTS 
131
BLANK FACES SLIGHTLY ANTAGONISTIC 
132
AND NOW ITS A HUMAN EXPERIENCE 
133
NOW THEYRE ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER 
134
SO ONCE THE KHAN ACADEMY KIND OF 
135
I QUIT MY JOB AND WE TURNED INTO A REAL ORGANIZATION 
136
WERE A NOT FOR PROFIT 
137
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
138
HOW DO WE TAKE WHAT THOSE TEACHERS WERE DOING TO THEIR NATURAL CONCLUSION 
139
AND SO WHAT IM SHOWING OVER HERE 
140
THESE ARE ACTUAL EXERCISES THAT I STARTED WRITING FOR MY COUSINS 
141
THE ONES I STARTED WERE MUCH MORE PRIMITIVE 
142
THIS IS KIND OF A MORE COMPETENT VERSION OF IT 
143
BUT THE PARADIGM HERE IS WELL WELL GENERATE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU NEED 
144
UNTIL YOU GET THAT CONCEPT UNTIL YOU GET TEN IN A ROW 
145
AND THE KHAN ACADEMY VIDEOS ARE THERE YOU GET HINTS THE ACTUAL STEPS FOR 
146
THAT PROBLEM IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
147
BUT THE PARADIGM IS IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY SIMPLE THING TEN IN A ROW AND 
148
YOU MOVE ON 
149
BUT ITS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHATS HAPPENING IN CLASSROOMS RIGHT NOW 
150
IN A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF A HOMEWORK LECTURE HOMEWORK 
151
LECTURE AND THEN YOU HAVE A SNAPSHOT EXAM 
152
AND THAT EXAM WHETHER YOU GET A 70% AN 80% A 90% OR 
153
A 95% THE CLASS MOVES ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC 
154
AND EVEN THAT 95% STUDENT WHAT WAS THE 5% THEY DIDNT KNOW 
155
MAYBE THEY DIDNT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RAISE SOMETHING TO THE ZERO POWER AND 
156
THEN YOU GO BUILD ON THAT IN THE NEXT CONCEPT 
157
THATS ANALOGOUS TO IMAGINE LEARNING TO RIDE A BICYCLE AND I GIVE YOU A BICYCLE 
158
MAYBE I GIVE YOU A LECTURE AHEAD OF TIME AND I GIVE YOU THAT BICYCLE FOR TWO WEEKS 
159
AND THEN I COME BACK AFTER TWO WEEKS AND I SAY 
160
WELL LETS SEE YOURE HAVING TROUBLE TAKING LEFT TURNS YOU CANT QUITE STOP 
161
YOURE AN 80% BICYCLIST SO I PUT A BIG C STAMP ON YOUR FOREHEAD 
162
 [LAUGH]  AND THEN I SAY HERES A UNICYCLE 
163
 [LAUGH]  BUT AS RIDICULOUS AS THAT SOUNDS 
164
THATS EXACTLY WHATS HAPPENING IN OUR CLASSROOMS RIGHT NOW 
165
AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU FAST FORWARD AND GOOD STUDENTS START FAILING ALGEBRA ALL 
166
OF A SUDDEN AND START FAILING CALCULUS ALL OF A SUDDEN 
167
DESPITE BEING SMART DESPITE HAVING GOOD TEACHERS AND ITS USUALLY BECAUSE THEY 
168
HAVE THESE SWISS CHEESE GAPS THAT KEPT BUILDING THROUGHOUT THEIR FOUNDATION 
169
SO OUR MODEL IS LEARN MATH THE WAY YOU LEARN ANYTHING 
170
LIKE THE WAY YOU LEARN A BICYCLE STAY ON THAT BICYCLE FALL OFF THAT BICYCLE 
171
DO IT AS LONG AS NECESSARY UNTIL YOU HAVE MASTERY 
172
THERE ARE TRADITIONAL MODEL IT PENALIZES YOU FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND FAILURE 
173
BUT IT DOES NOT EXPECT MASTERY 
174
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPERIMENT 
175
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO FAILURE BUT WE DO EXPECT MASTERY 
176
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE MODULES 
177
THIS IS TRIGONOMETRY 
178
THIS IS SHIFTING AND REFLECTING FUNCTIONS 
179
AND THEY ALL FIT TOGETHER 
180
WE HAVE ABOUT 90 OF THESE RIGHT NOW 
181
AND YOU COULD GO TO THE SITE RIGHT NOW ITS ALL FREE 
182
IM NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU ANYTHING 
183
BUT THE GENERAL IDEA IS THAT THEY ALL FIT INTO THIS KNOWLEDGE MAP 
184
THAT TOP NODE RIGHT THERE THATS LITERALLY SINGLE DIGIT ADDITION 
185
ITS LIKE ONE PLUS ONE IS EQUAL TO TWO 
186
AND THE PARADIGM IS ONCE YOU GET TEN IN A ROW ON THAT 
187
THEN IT KEEPS FORWARDING YOU TO MORE AND MORE ADVANCED MODULES 
188
SO IF YOU KEEP FURTHER DOWN THE KNOWLEDGE MAP 
189
WERE GETTING INTO MORE ADVANCED ARITHMETIC 
190
FURTHER DOWN YOU START GETTING INTO PRE-ALGEBRA AND EARLY ALGEBRA FURTHER 
191
DOWN YOU START GETTING INTO ALGEBRA ONE ALGEBRA TWO A LITTLE BIT OF PRE-CALCULUS 
192
AND THE IDEA IS FROM THIS WE CAN ACTUALLY TEACH EVERYTHING 
193
WELL EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE TAUGHT IN THIS TYPE OF A FRAMEWORK 
194
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE AND 
195
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS FROM THIS KNOWLEDGE MAP YOU HAVE LOGIC 
196
YOU HAVE COMPUTER PROGRAMMING YOU HAVE GRAMMAR YOU HAVE GENETICS 
197
ALL BASED OFF OF THAT CORE OF OKAY IF YOU KNOW THIS AND THAT 
198
NOW YOURE READY FOR THIS NEXT CONCEPT 
199
NOW THAT CAN WORK WELL FOR AN INDIVIDUAL LEARNER AND THEN I ENCOURAGE ONE FOR 
200
YOU TO DO IT WITH YOUR KIDS 
201
BUT I ALSO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE TO DO IT YOURSELF 
202
ITLL CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE DINNER TABLE 
203
BUT WHAT WE WANNA DO IS USE THE NATURAL CONCLUSION OF THE FLIPPING OF 
204
THE CLASSROOM THAT THOSE EARLY TEACHERS HAD EMAILED ME ABOUT 
205
AND SO WHAT IM SHOWING YOU HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY DATA FROM A PILOT IN 
206
THE LOS ALTOS SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THEY TOOK TWO FIFTH GRADE CLASSES AND 
207
TWO SEVENTH GRADE CLASSES AND COMPLETELY GUTTED THEIR OLD MATH CURRICULUM 
208
THESE KIDS ARENT USING TEXTBOOKS 
209
THEYRE NOT GETTING ONE SIZE FITS ALL LECTURES 
210
THEYRE DOING KHAN ACADEMY 
211
THEYRE DOING THAT SOFTWARE FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF THEIR MATH CLASS AND 
212
I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR WE DONT VIEW THIS AS THE COMPLETE MATH EDUCATION 
213
WHAT IT DOES IS AND THIS IS WHATS HAPPENING IN LOS ALTOS IT FREES UP TIME 
214
THIS IS THE BLOCKING AND 
215
TACKLING MAKING SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS 
216
AND IT FREES UP TIME FOR THE SIMULATIONS FOR THE GAMES FOR THE MECHANICS FOR 
217
THE ROBOT BUILDING FOR THE ESTIMATING HOW HIGH THAT HILL IS BASED ON ITS SHADOW 
218
AND SO THE PARADIGM IS THE TEACHER WALKS IN EVERYDAY 
219
EVERY KID WORKS AT THEIR OWN PACE AND A TEACHER GETS THIS IS ACTUALLY A LIVE 
220
DASHBOARD FROM LOS ALTOS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY LOOK AT THIS DASHBOARD 
221
EVERY ROW IS A STUDENT EVERY COLUMN IS ONE OF THOSE CONCEPTS 
222
GREEN MEANS THE STUDENTS ALREADY PROFICIENT 
223
BLUE MEANS THAT THEYRE WORKING ON IT NO NEED TO WORRY 
224
RED MEANS THEYRE STUCK 
225
AND WHAT THE TEACHER DOES IS LITERALLY JUST SAYS 
226
LET ME INTERVENE ON THE RED KIDS 
227
OR EVEN BETTER LET ME GET ONE OF THE GREEN KIDS WHO ARE ALREADY PROFICIENT IN 
228
THAT CONCEPT TO BE THE FIRST LINE OF ATTACK AND ACTUALLY TUTOR THEIR PEER 
229
 [APPLAUSE]  NOW 
230
I KINDA COME FROM A VERY DATA-CENTRIC REALITY SO WE DONT WANT THAT 
231
TEACHER TO EVEN GO AND INTERVENE AND HAVE TO ASK THE KID AWKWARD QUESTIONS 
232
OH WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND OR WHAT DO YOU DO UNDERSTAND AND ALL OF THE REST 
233
SO OUR PARADIGM IS TO REALLY ARM THE TEACHERS WITH AS MUCH DATA AS POSSIBLE 
234
REALLY DATA THAT IN ALMOST ANY OTHER FIELD IS EXPECTED IF YOURE IN FINANCE OR 
235
MARKETING OR MANUFACTURING 
236
AND SO THE TEACHERS CAN ACTUALLY DIAGNOSE WHATS WRONG WITH THE STUDENTS SO 
237
THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR INTERACTION AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE 
238
SO NOW THE TEACHERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN UP TO 
239
HOW LONG THEYVE BEEN SPENDING EVERY DAY 
240
WHAT VIDEOS HAVE THEY BEEN WATCHING 
241
WHEN DID THEY PAUSE THE VIDEOS 
242
WHAT DID THEY STOP WATCHING 
243
WHAT EXERCISES ARE THEY USING 
244
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN FOCUSED ON 
245
THE OUTER CIRCLE SHOWS WHAT THE EXERCISES THEY WERE FOCUSED ON 
246
THE INNER CIRCLE SHOWS THE VIDEOS THEYRE FOCUSED ON 
247
AND THE DATA GETS PRETTY GRANULAR 
248
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE EXACT PROBLEMS THAT THE STUDENT GOT RIGHT OR WRONG 
249
RED IS WRONG BLUE IS RIGHT 
250
THE LEFT MOST QUESTION IS THE FIRST QUESTION THAT THE STUDENT ATTEMPTED 
251
THEY WATCHED THE VIDEO RIGHT OVER THERE 
252
AND THEN YOU COULD SEE EVENTUALLY THEY WERE ABLE TO GET TEN IN A ROW 
253
ITS ALMOST LIKE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THEM LEARNING OVER THOSE LAST TEN PROBLEMS 
254
THEY ALSO GOT FASTER 
255
THE HEIGHT IS HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM 
256
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SELF-PACED LEARNING 
257
IT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE IN EDUCATION SPEAK DIFFERENTIATED LEARNING BUT 
258
ITS KIND OF CRAZY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT IN A CLASSROOM 
259
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WEVE DONE THIS IN EVERY CLASS ROOM OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
260
IF YOU GO FIVE DAYS INTO IT THERES A GROUP OF KIDS WHO HAVE RACED AHEAD AND 
261
THERES A GROUP OF KIDS WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER 
262
AND IN A TRADITIONAL MODEL IF YOU DO THE SNAPSHOT ASSESSMENT YOU SAY OH 
263
THESE ARE THE GIFTED KIDS THESE ARE THE SLOW KIDS 
264
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE TRACKED DIFFERENTLY 
265
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT CLASSES 
266
BUT WHEN YOU LET EVERY STUDENT WORK AT THEIR OWN PACE AND WE SEE IT OVER AND 
267
OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
268
YOU SEE STUDENTS WHO TOOK A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TIME ON ONE CONCEPT OR THE OTHER 
269
BUT ONCE THEY GET THROUGH THAT CONCEPT THEY JUST RACE AHEAD 
270
AND SO THE SAME KIDS YOU THOUGHT WERE SLOW SIX WEEKS AGO 
271
YOU NOW WOULD THINK ARE GIFTED 
272
AND WERE SEEING IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND 
273
IT MAKES YOU REALLY WONDER KIND OF HOW MUCH ALL OF THE LABELS 
274
MAYBE US HAVE BENEFITED FROM WERE REALLY JUST DUE TO A COINCIDENCE OF TIME 
275
NOW AS VALUABLE AS SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS IN A DISTRICT LIKE LOS ALTOS 
276
OUR GOAL IS TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO HUMANIZE NOT JUST IN LOS ALTOS BUT 
277
KIND OF ON A GLOBAL SCALE WHATS HAPPENING IN EDUCATION 
278
ACTUALLY THAT KIND OF RINGS AN INTERESTING POINT THAT A LOT OF THE EFFORT 
279
IN HUMANIZING THE CLASSROOM IS FOCUSED ON STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIONS 
280
IN OUR MIND THE RELEVANT METRIC IS STUDENT TO VALUABLE HUMAN TIME 
281
WITH THE TEACHER RATION 
282
SO IN A TRADITIONAL MODEL MOST OF THE TEACHERS TIME IS SPENT DOING LECTURES AND 
283
GRADING TEST AND WHAT NOT 
284
MAYBE 5% OF THEIR TIME IS ACTUALLY SITTING NEXT TO STUDENTS AND 
285
ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THEM 
286
NOW 100% OF THEIR TIME IS 
287
SO ONCE AGAIN USING TECHNOLOGY NOT JUST FLIPPING THE CLASSROOM 
288
YOURE HUMANIZING THE CLASSROOM ID ARGUE BY A FACTOR OF FIVE OR TEN 
289
AND AS VALUABLE AS IT IS IN LOS ALTOS 
290
IMAGINE WHAT THAT DOES TO THE ADULT LEARNER WHOS EMBARRASSED TO GO BACK AND 
291
LEARN STUFF THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE GOING BACK TO COLLEGE 
292
IMAGINE WHAT IT DOES TO A STREET KID IN CALCUTTA WHO HAS TO HELP 
293
HIS FAMILY DURING THE DAY AND THATS THE REASON WHY HE OR SHE CANT GO TO SCHOOL 
294
NOW THEY CAN SPEND TWO HOURS A DAY AND REMEDIATE OR GET UP TO SPEED AND 
295
NOT FEEL EMBARRASSED ABOUT WHAT THEY DO OR DONT KNOW 
296
NOW IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT THE PEERS TEACHING EACH 
297
OTHER INSIDE OF A CLASSROOM BUT THIS IS ALL ONE SYSTEM 
298
THERES NO REASON WHY YOU CANT HAVE THAT PEER TO PEER TUTORING BEYOND THAT ONE 
299
CLASSROOM 
300
IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT STUDENT IN CALCUTTA ALL OF A SUDDEN CAN TUTOR YOUR 
301
SON OR YOUR SON CAN TUTOR THAT KID IN CALCUTTA 
302
AND I THINK WHAT YOULL SEE EMERGING IS THIS NOTION OF 
303
A GLOBAL ONE WORLD CLASSROOM 
304
AND THATS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WERE TRYING TO BUILD 
305
THANK YOU 
306
 [APPLAUSE]  AWESOME 
307
VERY GOOD TALKING TO YOU [INAUDIBLE] 
308
 OH OKAY 
309
 [APPLAUSE]  [APPLAUSE] 
310
 OKAY 
311
 [APPLAUSE] 
312
 IVE SEEN SOME THINGS YOURE DOING 
313
IN THE SYSTEM THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MOTIVATION AND FEEDBACK 
314
 ENERGY POINTS MERIT BADGES 
315
TELL ME WHAT YOURE THINKING THERE 
316
 OH YEAH NO 
317
WE HAVE AN AWESOME TEAM WORKING ON IT 
318
ITS NOT AND I HAVE TO BE CLEAR ITS NOT JUST ME ANYMORE 
319
IM STILL DOING ALL THE VIDEOS 
320
WE HAVE A KIND OF A ROCK STAR TEAM DOING THE SOFTWARE 
321
YEAH WEVE PUT A BUNCH OF GAME MECHANICS IN THERE WHERE YOU GET THESE BADGES 
322
WERE GONNA START HAVING LEADER BOARDS BY AREAS AND YOU GET POINTS 
323
ITS ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY INTERESTING  JUST THE WORDING OF THE BADGING OR 
324
HOW MANY POINTS YOU GET FOR DOING SOMETHING WE SEE ON A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS 
325
LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FIFTH GRADERS OR SIXTH GRADERS GOING ONE DIRECTION OR 
326
ANOTHER DEPENDING ON WHAT BADGE YOU GIVE THEM 
327
[LAUGH]  AND 
328
THE COLLABORATION YOURE DOING WITH LOS ALTOS HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT 
329
 YEAH NO LOS ALTOS HAS BEEN KIND OF IT WAS KIND OF CRAZY 
330
ONCE AGAIN I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE USED IN CLASSROOMS 
331
SOMEONE FROM THEIR BOARD CAME AND SAID 
332
OH WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD CARTE BLANCHE IN A CLASSROOM 
333
AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW 
334
I WOULD JUST EVERY STUDENT WORK AT THEIR OWN PACE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
335
WED GIVE A DASHBOARD AND YOU KNOW THEY SAID OH THIS IS KIND OF RADICAL 
336
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
337
AND ME AND THE REST OF THE TEAM LIKE OH YOU KNOW 
338
THEYRE NEVER GONNA WANT TO DO THIS 
339
BUT LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE LIKE CAN YOU START IN TWO WEEKS 
340
[LAUGH]  SO ITS THIS FIFTH GRADE MATH 
341
THATS GOING ON RIGHT NOW 
342
 ITS TWO FIFTH GRADE CLASSES AND 
343
TWO SEVENTH GRADE CLASSES AND I THINK THEYRE DOING IT AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL AND 
344
I THINK WHAT THEYRE EXCITED ABOUT IS  THEY CAN NOW FOLLOW THESE KIDS 
345
ITS NOT AN ONLY IN SCHOOL THING 
346
ON CHRISTMAS WE SAW SOME OF THE KIDS WERE DOING 
347
AND WE CAN TRACK EVERYTHING 
348
SO IT CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THEM AS THEY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE DISTRICT THROUGH 
349
THE SUMMER AS THEY GO FROM ONE TEACHER TO THE NEXT 
350
YOU HAVE THIS CONTINUITY OF DATA THAT EVEN AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL THEY CAN SEE 
351
 SO SOME OF THOSE VIEWS WE SAW WERE FOR 
352
THE TEACHER TO GO IN AND TRACK ACTUALLY WHATS GOING ON WITH THOSE KIDS 
353
SO YOURE GIVING FEEDBACK ON THOSE TEACHER VIEWS TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK THEY NEED 
354
 OH YEAH ACTUALLY 
355
MOST OF THOSE WERE KIND OF SPECS BY THE TEACHERS 
356
WE MADE SOME OF THOSE FOR STUDENTS SO THEY COULD SEE THEIR DATA BUT 
357
WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT DESIGN LOOP WITH THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES AND 
358
THEYRE LITERALLY SAYING HEY YOU KNOW THIS IS NICE BUT 
359
LIKE THAT FOCUS GRAPH A LOT OF THE TEACHERS SAID I HAVE A FEELING THAT A LOT 
360
OF THE KIDS ARE JUMPING AROUND AND NOT FOCUSING ON ONE TOPIC SO 
361
WE MADE THAT FOCUS  A DIAGRAM FOR THEM 
362
SO ITS ALL BEEN TEACHER-DRIVEN ITS BEEN PRETTY CRAZY 
363
 IS THIS READY FOR PRIME TIME 
364
DO YOU THINK A LOT OF CLASSES NEXT SCHOOL YEAR SHOULD TRY THIS THING OUT 
365
 YEAH ITS READY WE GOT A MILLION PEOPLE ON THE SITE ALREADY SO 
366
WE CAN HANDLE A FEW MORE 
367
AND ITS A [LAUGH] ITS 
368
NO REASON WHY IT REALLY CANT HAPPEN IN EVERY CLASSROOM IN AMERICA TOMORROW 
369
 AND THE VISION OF THE TUTORING THING 
370
THE IDEA THERE IS IF IM CONFUSED ABOUT A TOPIC 
371
SOMEHOW RIGHT IN USER INTERFACE ID FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE VOLUNTEERING 
372
MAYBE SEE THEIR REPUTATION AND I COULD SCHEDULE AND CONNECT UP WITH THOSE PEOPLE 
373
 ABSOLUTELY 
374
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I RECOMMEND EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE TO DO IS YOU 
375
CAN THOSE DASHBOARDS THAT TEACHERS HAVE YOU CAN GO LOG IN RIGHT NOW AND YOU COULD 
376
GET YOU COULD ESSENTIALLY BECOME A COACH FOR YOUR KIDS YOUR NEPHEWS YOUR COUSINS 
377
OR MAYBE SOME KIDS AT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 
378
AND YEAH YOU CAN START BECOMING A MENTOR OR A TUTOR REALLY IMMEDIATELY 
379
YEAH HEY ITS ALL THERE 
380
WELL ITS AMAZING 
381
I THINK YOUVE JUST GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION 
382
THANK YOU 
383
 [APPLAUSE]  THANK YOU 
384
 [APPLAUSE] 
385
 [MUSIC]
