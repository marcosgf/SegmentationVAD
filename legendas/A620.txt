I GOT MY START IN SOFTWARE WORKING ON SHREK ACTUALLY A LONG LONG TIME AGO 
1
AND YOURE TAKING THESE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS LOOPS AND COUNTERS AND 
2
ALGORITHMS AND YOU USE THAT STUFF EVERY SINGLE DAY AND YOU GRADUALLY BUILD IT ALL 
3
UP AND IT JUST TURNS INTO THIS TOOL THAT AN ARTIST CAN TAKE AND 
4
THEN JUST RUN WITH IT AND JUST DO REALLY AMAZING SAME THINGS WITH IT 
5
HI THERE 
6
SO YOU DID YOUR SQUARES GOOD JOB 
7
WERE GONNA MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER THIS TIME 
8
WERE GONNA DO THE SAME SQUARES 
9
ONLY WERE GOING TO USE SOMETHING CALLED A COUNTER LOOP 
10
A COUNTER LOOP IS JUST LIKE A REGULAR LOOP BUT 
11
EVERY TIME YOU LOOP AROUND YOU ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THE NUMBER 
12
SO YOU SEE YOUR COUNTER LOOP RIGHT HERE IT CAME FROM THE LOOP SECTION AND 
13
THEN YOUVE GOT YOUR DRAW SQUARE FUNCTION THAT YOUVE BEEN USING ALL ALONG 
14
SO NOW WELL JUST GO INTO THE VARIABLE SECTION 
15
YOU PULL OUT THAT COUNTER BLOCK AND STICK IT INTO THE LENGTH BIN 
16
SO NOW WHAT YOUVE GOT SOMETHING THAT SAYS COUNT WITH COUNTER 
17
FROM 50 TO 90 USING 10 DRAW SQUARE 
18
SO WHATS THAT GONNA DO IS ITS GONNA FIRST DRAW A SQUARE SIDES 50 
19
THEN IT WILL ADD 10 TO THE COUNTER DRAW IT AGAIN AND THEN AS IT LOOPS AROUND IT 
20
ADDS 10 EACH TIME SO YOU GET SQUARES OF 50 60 70 80 90 
21
SO YOUR ZOMBIES GONNA BE A MASTER ARTIST

GOOD JOB
