EVERY ATHLETE KNOWS THAT YOU GET GOOD BY PRACTICING 
1
BY REPEATING THE SAME MOVES UNTIL YOU GET REALLY GOOD OR UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR GOAL 
2
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
3
I WOULDNT LEAVE PRACTICE UNTIL I MADE TEN FREETHROWS IN A ROW 
4
SIMILARLY WHEN YOU GET TO A COMPUTER PROGRAM AND 
5
REPEAT A COMMAND YOU CAN GIVE IT AN EXACT NUMBER OF TIMES TO REPEAT 
6
OR YOU CAN DEFINE A GOAL AND

TELL IT TO REPEAT THE COMMAND UNTIL IT REACHES SOME GOAL 
8

10
YOU CAN USE THE REPEAT UNTIL BLOCK TO TELL THE ANGRY BIRD TO DO THE SAME THING

UNTIL IT GETS THE PIG OR UNTIL IT CRASHES INTO THE WALL 
12

13
REPEAT A SERIES OF ACTIONS
