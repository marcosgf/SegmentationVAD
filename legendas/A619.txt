PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS EVERY DAY 
1
FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE YOU GO OUTSIDE YOU KIND OF HAVE AN IF STATEMENT THAT SAYS 
2
IF ITS RAINING THEN I NEED TO GET MY JACKET 
3
AND COMPUTERS ARE AMAZING ONCE YOU DECIDE THOSE KINDS OF STATEMENTS 
4
THAT THEY CAN RELIABLY EXECUTE THOSE THINGS AT UNBELIEVABLE SPEED 
5
AND SO A COMPUTER PROGRAM REALLY IS A LITTLE BIT OF MATH AND 
6
SOME IF STATEMENTS WHERE THE DECISION GETS MADE 
7
SO IN THIS PUZZLE THE IF BLOCK HELPS THE ZOMBIE MAKE A DECISION 
8
 BRAINS  IT SHUTS SOMETHING 
9
FOR EXAMPLE LETS USE THE BLOCK THAT SAYS IF THERES A PATH TO THE LEFT AND 
10
PUT A TURN LEFT COMMAND INSIDE IT 
11
SO WERE TELLING THE ZOMBIE TO CHECK ITS SURROUNDING 
12
SEE IF THERES THAT PATH ON THE LEFT AND IF SO MAKE THAT TURN 
13
AND THEN WE USE THE MOVE FORWARD BLOCK INSIDE THIS REPEAT 
14
TO GET IT TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD AS LONG AS IT JUST WANTS TO GO STRAIGHT 
15
THEN WHEN THERES THE TURN 
16
THE IF BLOCK WILL TELL IT TO MAKE THIS TURN TO THE LEFT 
17
AND YOU CAN SEE IF WE DO THAT IF WERE TAKING THE TURN TO THE LEFT AND 
18
OTHERWISE MOVING FORWARD WELL ACHIEVE OUR GOAL 
19
SO ITS AN EXAMPLE OF USING AN IF STATEMENT 
20
WHICH IS REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 
21
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I LEARNED WAS HOW TO WRITE A PROGRAM TO PLAY TICTACTOE 
22
SO I HAD IF STATEMENTS TO SAY OKAY IF THE OTHER PERSON IS ABOUT TO WIN GO AHEAD AND 
23
BLOCK THAT SPOT 
24
SO HAVE FUN LEARNING HOW TO USE IF STATEMENTS ITS A KEY CONCEPT
