00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.420
A function is pretty much a sequence of
instructions to perform a specific task.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.610
Basically if you're building a car,

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.390
what you want the car to
do is what a function is.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.940
Turn right, you wanna turn left,

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.260
you want it to drive, you want it to stop,
all those could be functions.

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.450
Now that we're back with our farmer,

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.340
we're going to start learning
how to define functions.

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.930
You'll notice in your
workspace that there's

9
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.260
a block that has a star in the corner.

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.370
This is a function definition.

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.550
At the top part of the block,
it tells us the name in the function.

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.360
The blocks inside of
it tells what it does.

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.960
This definition sits in the workspace,
but our farmer

14
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.560
won't do the actions inside the function
until we drag out the function block.

15
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.180
To do that you need to click on
the functions category in the menu and

16
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.650
drag out the fill 5 function.

17
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.260
Let's put the fun back in functions.
