2
00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:13.905
I was 13 when I first got
access to a computer.

3
00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:14.822
>> My parents.

4
00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:18.310
Bought me a Macintosh in 1984
when I was eight years old.

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.940
>> I was in sixth grade.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.300
>> I learned to code in college.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.860
>> Freshman year, first semester,
intro to computer science.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.535
>> I wrote a program to
>> Play Tic Tac Toe.

9
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:29.965
>> I think it was pretty
humble beginnings.

10
00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:34.735
I think the first program I wrote asked
things like, what's your favorite color,

11
00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:35.725
or how old are you.

12
00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.775
>> I first learned how to
make a green circle and

13
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:40.785
a red square appear on the screen.

14
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:42.835
>> The first time I actually
had something come up and

15
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:47.325
say, hello world, I made a computer
do that, it was just astonishing.

16
00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:50.560
>> Learning how to program
didn't start off as wanting to

17
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.000
>> Learn all of computer science or

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.330
trying to master this discipline or
anything like that.

19
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.500
I just started off because I wanted
to do this one simple thing.

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.350
I wanted to make something that
was fun for myself and my sisters.

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.940
And I wrote this little program, then
basically just add a little bit to it.

22
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.340
And when I needed to learn something new,
I looked it up,

23
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
either in a book or on the Internet,
and then added a little bit to it.

24
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.490
>> It's really not unlike
playing an instrument or

25
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.935
something, or
>> Or playing a sport.

26
00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:17.104
>> [NOISE] Chris Bosh.

27
00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:21.360
>> It starts being very intimidating, but
you kinda get the hang of it over time.

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360
>> Coding is something
that can be learned,

29
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.480
and I know it can be intimidating and
a lot of things are intimidating.

30
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.690
But what isn't.

31
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.910
>> A lot of the coding that people
do is actually fairly simple.

32
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.544
It's more about the process of breaking
down problems then, you know, sort of

33
00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:42.447
coming up with complicated algorithms
as people traditionally think about it.

34
00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.400
>> You don't have to be
a genius to know how to code.

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.730
You need to be determined.

36
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.120
>> Addition, subtraction, that's about it.

37
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.710
>> You should probably know
your multiplication tables.

38
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.370
>> You don't have to be a genius to code.

39
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.520
Do you have to be a genius to read?

40
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.200
>> Even if you want to become a race car
driver or play baseball, or, you know,

41
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.105
build a house, all of these things have
been turned upside down by software.

42
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.230
>> What it is is, you know,
computers are everywhere.

43
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.890
You want to work in agriculture?

44
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.330
Do you want to work in entertainment?

45
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.077
Do you want to work in manufacturing,
it's just all over.

47
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:31.260
>> Here we are, in 2013.

48
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.970
We all depend on technology,
to communicate, to bank, information.

49
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.284
And none of us know how to read and
write code.

50
00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:48.732
>> When I was in school I was in this
after school group called the Whiz Kids,

51
00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:52.650
and when people found out, they laughed
at me and, you know, all these things.

52
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.890
And I'm like, man, I don't care.

53
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.856
I think it's cool and I'm learning
a lot and some of my friends have jobs.

[MUSIC]

55
00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:06.180
>> Our policy is literally to hire as
many talented engineers as we can find.

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.950
The whole limit in the system is
just that there just aren't enough

57
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.560
people who are trained and
have these skills today.

58
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.423
>> To get the very best people, we try to
make the office as awesome as possible.

60
00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:41.154
You're a fantastic chef.

61
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.620
>> Free food.

62
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.430
>> Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

63
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.890
>> Free laundry.

64
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.358
>> Snacks.

65
00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:51.406
>> Even places to play, and
video games and scooters.

66
00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:55.563
There's all these kind of interesting
things around the office, and

67
00:03:55.563 --> 00:04:00.571
places where people can play or relax, or
go to think or play music, or be creative.

69
00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:05.701
Whether you're trying to make a lot of
money, or whether you just wanna change

70
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.980
the world, computer programming is
an incredibly empowering skill to learn.

71
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.180
>> I think if someone had told me that

72
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.940
software is really about
>> Humanity that it's really about helping

73
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.750
people by using computer technology, it
would've changed my outlook a lot earlier.

74
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.650
>> To be able to actually come up with
an idea and then see it in your hands and

75
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.590
then be able to press a button and
have been millions of people's hands,

76
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.230
I mean, I think we're the
>> First generation in the world that's

77
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.050
really ever had that kind of experience.

78
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.690
>> Just to think that you can start
something in your college dorm room and

79
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.870
you can have a set of people who haven't
built a big company before come together

80
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.910
and build something that
a billion people use as part

81
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.018
of their daily lives [LAUGH] is
just crazy to think about, right?

82
00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:51.787
It's really humbling and it's amazing.

83
00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:54.900
The programmers of tomorrow
are the wizards of the future.

84
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.600
You know, you're gonna look like you have
magic powers, compared to everybody else.

85
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.140
>> It's amazing.

86
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.540
I think it's the closest thing
we have to a superpower.

87
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.527
>> Great coders are today's rock stars.

88
00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:08.246
That's it.
