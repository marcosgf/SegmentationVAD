00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:06.233
[SOUND]

2
00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:16.200
[APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.818
>> Khan Academy is most known for

4
00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.312
its collection of videos.

5
00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:24.838
So before I go any father,
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

6
00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:27.800
So the hypotenuse is now going to be 5.

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.260
This animals fossils are only found
in this area of South America.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.030
A nice clean band here and
this part of Africa.

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.120
We could integrate over the surface and
the notation usually is a capital sigma,

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.290
national assembly, they create
the committee of public safety.

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.980
Which sounds like a very nice committee.

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.990
Notice this is an aldehyde and
it's an alcohol.

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.310
Start differentiating into effector and
memory cells.

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.760
A galaxy, hey, there's another galaxy.

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.100
Oh, look, there's another galaxy.

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.900
And for dollars is their 30 million plus

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.490
the $20 million from
the American manufacturer.

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.446
If this does not blow your mind,
then you have no emotion.

19
00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:11.877
[APPLAUSE] We now have on
the order of 2200 videos covering

20
00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:17.948
everything from basic arithmetic
all the way to vector calculus and

21
00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:21.477
some of the stuff that you saw up there.

22
00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.738
We have a million students
a month using the site,

23
00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:31.520
watching on the order of 100
to 200,000 videos a day.

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.110
But what we're gonna talk about in this
is how we're going to the next level.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.550
But before I do that,

26
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.510
I wanna talk a little bit about
really just how I got started.

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.790
Some of you all might now,

28
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.770
about five years ago I was
an analyst at a hedge fund.

29
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.360
And I was in Boston, and I was tutoring
my cousins in New Orleans remotely.

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,

31
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.660
really just as kind of a nice to have,
just kind of a supplement for my cousins.

32
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.780
Something that might give them
a refresher or something.

33
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.670
And as soon as I put those first YouTube
videos up, something interesting happened.

34
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.970
Actually, a bunch of
interesting things happened.

35
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.889
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.

36
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.445
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

37
00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:23.150
>> [LAUGH]

38
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.210
>> And once you get over the backhanded

39
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.020
nature of that, there was actually
something very profound there.

40
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.390
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin

41
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.120
to their cousin.

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.680
At first it's very unintuitive, but when
you actually think about it from their

43
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.080
point of view it makes a ton of sense.

44
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
You have this situation where now they
can pause and repeat their cousin.

45
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.790
Now they can, without feeling like they're
wasting my time, they could, if they have

46
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.600
to review something that they should
have learned a couple of weeks ago or

47
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.120
maybe a couple of years ago they
don't have to be embarrassed and

48
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.060
ask their cousin,
they can just watch those videos.

49
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.340
If they're bored, they can go ahead,
they can watch it at their own time,

50
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.760
at their own pace.

51
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.490
And probably,
the least appreciated, I guess,

52
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.020
aspect of this,
is the notion that the very first time,

53
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.840
the very first time that you're trying
to get your brain around a new concept.

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.810
The very last thing you need is
a another human being saying,

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.730
do you understand this?

56
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.830
And that what's happening with
the interaction with my cousins before and

57
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.680
now they can just do it kind of in
the intimacy of their own room.

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410
The other thing that happened
is I put it on YouTube just for

59
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.430
you know, I saw no reason to make it
private so I let other people watch it.

60
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.410
And then people started stumbling on it.

61
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.010
And I started getting some comments and
some letters and

62
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.770
all sorts of kind of feedback from
random people around the world.

63
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.070
And these are just a few.

64
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.650
This is actually from one of
the original calculus videos.

65
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.730
And someone wrote just on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment.

66
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.185
First time I smiled at doing a derivative.

67
00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:04.190
>> [LAUGH]
>> Let's pause here.

68
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.005
This person did a derivative and
then they smiled.

69
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.220
>> [LAUGH]
>> And

70
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.740
then in response to that same comment,
this was on the thread.

71
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.780
You can go on YouTube and
look at these comments someone else wrote,

72
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.800
same thing here.

73
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.270
I actually got a natural high and
a good mood for the entire day.

74
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.900
Since I remember seeing all of
this Matrix text in class, and

75
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.161
here I'm all like, I know Kung Fu.

76
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:30.730
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

77
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.420
And we got a lot of feedback along those

78
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.070
lines.

79
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.790
It clearly was helping people.

80
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.130
But then,
as the viewership kept growing, and

81
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.580
kept growing, I started getting
letters from people, and it was

82
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.900
starting to become clear that it was
actually more than just a nice to have.

83
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.750
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters.

84
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.180
My 12 year old son has autism, and
has had a terrible time with math.

85
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.530
We have tried everything,
viewed everything, bought everything.

86
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.180
We stumbled on your video on decimals,
and I got through.

87
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.310
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions,
again he got it.

88
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.530
We could not believe it.

89
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.470
He is so excited.

90
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.970
And so you can imagine, here I was,

91
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.765
an analyst that it was very strange for
me to do something a social value.

92
00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:16.675
[LAUGH] I was.

93
00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:22.795
[APPLAUSE] But
I was excited so I kept going,

94
00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:30.140
and then a few other things
started to dawn on me.

95
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.040
That not only wold it help
my cousins right now or

96
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.580
these people who were sending letters,
but it could maybe that this content will

97
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.970
never go old, that it could help
their kids or their grand kids.

98
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.805
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos
on calculus, I wouldn't have to.

99
00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:49.940
[LAUGH] Assuming he was good.

100
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.775
We don't know.

101
00:05:50.775 --> 00:05:55.330
[LAUGH] [LAUGH] The other
thing that happened.

102
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.060
And, even at this point,
I said okay maybe it's a good supplement.

103
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.640
It's good for motivated students.

104
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.290
It's good for maybe home schoolers.

105
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.900
But I didn't think it would be
something that would somehow penetrate

106
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.480
the classroom.

107
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.580
But then I started getting
letters from teachers.

108
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.760
And the teachers would write saying, we've
used your videos to flip the classroom.

109
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.690
You've given the lectures.

110
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.410
So now what we do, and this could actually
happen in every classroom in America

111
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.400
tomorrow, what I do is I assign
the lectures for homework and

112
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.340
what used to be homework I now have
students doing in the classroom.

113
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.275
And I wanna pause here for.

114
00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:33.520
[APPLAUSE] I want to pause here for

115
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.120
a second because there's
a couple of interesting things.

116
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.380
One, when those teachers are doing
that there's the obvious benefit.

117
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.990
There's the benefit
that now their students

118
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.240
can enjoy the videos in
the way that my cousins did.

119
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.010
They can pause, repeat at their own pace,
at their own time.

120
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.200
But the more interesting thing, and

121
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.810
this is the unintuitive thing when you
talk about technology in the classroom.

122
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.780
By removing the one size fits
all lecture from the classroom,

123
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.470
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home.

124
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.630
And then when you go to the classroom,
letting them do work,

125
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.420
having the teacher walk around.

126
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.820
Having the peers actually be able
to interact with each other.

127
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.480
These teachers have used technology
to humanize the classroom.

128
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.200
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience, a bunch of,

129
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.230
30 kids with their fingers on lips,
not allowed to interact with each other.

130
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.760
A teacher, no matter how good,

131
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.510
has to give this kind of one size
fits all lecture to 30 students.

132
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.700
Blank faces, slightly antagonistic.

133
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.020
And now it's a human experience.

134
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.570
Now they're actually
interacting with each other.

135
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.440
So once the Khan Academy kind of.

136
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.870
I quit my job, and
we turned into a real organization.

137
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.890
We're a not for profit.

138
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.270
The question is,
how do we take this to the next level?

139
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.211
How do we take what those teachers were
doing to their natural conclusion?

140
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:48.954
And so, what I'm showing over here,

141
00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:53.777
these are actual exercises that I
started writing for my cousins.

142
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:55.489
The ones I started were
much more primitive.

143
00:07:55.489 --> 00:07:58.883
This is kind of a more
competent version of it.

144
00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:02.641
But the paradigm here is well, we'll
generate as many questions as you need

145
00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:05.356
until you get that concept,
until you get ten in a row.

146
00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.650
And the Khan Academy videos are there,
you get hints the actual steps for

147
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.660
that problem if you
don't know how to do it.

148
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.459
But the paradigm is it seems like
a very simple thing, ten in a row and

149
00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:14.965
you move on.

150
00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:18.740
But it's fundamentally different than
what's happening in classrooms right now.

151
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.583
In a traditional classroom you have
a couple of a homework, lecture, homework,

152
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:26.122
lecture and then you have a snapshot exam.

153
00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:30.555
And that exam whether you get a 70%,
an 80%, a 90% or

154
00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:33.802
a 95% the class moves
on to the next topic.

155
00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:37.660
And even that 95% student,
what was the 5% they didn't know.

156
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.376
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zero power, and

157
00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:43.380
then you go build on
that in the next concept.

158
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.220
That's analogous to imagine learning to
ride a bicycle, and I give you a bicycle.

159
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.910
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,
and I give you that bicycle for two weeks.

160
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.169
And then I come back after two weeks and
I say,

161
00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:58.350
well let's see you're having trouble
taking left turns, you can't quite stop.

162
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.860
You're an 80% bicyclist, so
I put a big C stamp on your forehead.

163
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.381
>> [LAUGH]
>> And then I say here's a unicycle.

164
00:09:05.381 --> 00:09:08.843
>> [LAUGH]
>> But as ridiculous as that sounds,

165
00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:12.670
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

166
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.650
And the idea is that you fast forward, and
good students start failing algebra all

167
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.500
of a sudden, and
start failing calculus all of a sudden.

168
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.720
Despite being smart, despite having good
teachers, and it's usually because they

169
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.330
have these swiss cheese gaps that kept
building throughout their foundation.

170
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.660
So, our model is learn math
the way you learn anything.

171
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.760
Like the way you learn a bicycle, stay
on that bicycle, fall off that bicycle.

172
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.896
Do it as long as necessary
until you have mastery.

173
00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:42.700
There are traditional model, it penalizes
you for experimentation and failure,

174
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.100
but it does not expect mastery.

175
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.730
We encourage you to experiment.

176
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.330
We encourage you to failure,
but we do expect mastery.

177
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.000
This is just another one of the modules.

178
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.740
This is trigonometry.

179
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.930
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

180
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.420
And they all fit together.

181
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.460
We have about 90 of these right now.

182
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.153
And you could go to the site right now,
it's all free.

183
00:10:03.153 --> 00:10:04.740
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

184
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.970
But the general idea is that they
all fit into this knowledge map.

185
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.090
That top node right there,
that's literally single digit addition.

186
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.980
It's like one plus one is equal to two.

187
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.820
And the paradigm is once you
get ten in a row on that,

188
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.370
then it keeps forwarding you to more and
more advanced modules.

189
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.914
So, if you keep further
down the knowledge map,

190
00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:24.760
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

191
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.110
Further down you start getting into
pre-algebra and early algebra, further

192
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.650
down you start getting into algebra one,
algebra two, a little bit of pre-calculus.

193
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.840
And the idea is from this,
we can actually teach everything.

194
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.710
Well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.

195
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.810
So you can imagine, and

196
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.590
this is what we are working on,
is from this knowledge map you have logic,

197
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.710
you have computer programming,
you have grammar, you have genetics.

198
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.740
All based off of that core of okay,
if you know this and that,

199
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.920
now you're ready for this next concept.

200
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.830
Now, that can work well for an individual
learner, and then I encourage one, for

201
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.570
you to do it with your kids.

202
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.828
But I also encourage everyone in
the audience to do it yourself.

203
00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.390
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.

204
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.999
But what we wanna do is use the natural
conclusion of the flipping of

205
00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:12.427
the classroom that those early
teachers had emailed me about.

206
00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:15.495
And so what I'm showing you here,
this is actually data from a pilot in

207
00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:18.771
the Los Altos School District, where
they took two fifth grade classes and

208
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:22.410
two seventh grade classes and completely
gutted their old math curriculum.

209
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.700
These kids aren't using textbooks.

210
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.530
They're not getting one
size fits all lectures.

211
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.670
They're doing Khan Academy.

212
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.290
They're doing that software for
roughly half of their math class, and

213
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.170
I wanna make it clear, we don't view
this as the complete math education.

214
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.720
What it does is, and this is what's
happening in Los Altos, it frees up time.

215
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.590
This is the blocking and

216
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.380
tackling, making sure you know how
to deal with a system of equations.

217
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.210
And it frees up time for the simulations,
for the games, for the mechanics, for

218
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.360
the robot building, for the estimating how
high that hill is based on its shadow.

219
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.000
And so the paradigm is,
the teacher walks in everyday.

220
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.190
Every kid works at their own pace, and
a teacher gets, this is actually a live

221
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.930
dashboard from Los Altos School District,
and they look at this dashboard.

222
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.340
Every row is a student,
every column is one of those concepts.

223
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.420
Green means the student's
already proficient.

224
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.090
Blue means that they're working on it,
no need to worry.

225
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.000
Red means they're stuck.

226
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.260
And what the teacher does
is literally just says,

227
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.750
let me intervene on the red kids.

228
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.550
Or even better, let me get one of the
green kids who are already proficient in

229
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.357
that concept to be the first line of
attack, and actually tutor their peer.

230
00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:29.220
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Now,

231
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.680
I kinda come from a very data-centric
reality, so we don't want that

232
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.960
teacher to even go and intervene and
have to ask the kid awkward questions.

233
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.400
Oh, what do you not understand, or what do
you do understand, and all of the rest.

234
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.490
So our paradigm is to really arm the
teachers with as much data as possible,

235
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.872
really data that, in almost any other
field, is expected if you're in finance or

236
00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:48.163
marketing or manufacturing.

237
00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:51.079
And so the teachers can actually diagnose
what's wrong with the students, so

238
00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:53.537
that they can make their interaction
as productive as possible.

239
00:12:53.537 --> 00:12:56.670
So, now the teachers know exactly
what the students have been up to,

240
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.100
how long they've been spending every day.

241
00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.330
What videos have they been watching?

242
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.790
When did they pause the videos?

243
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.990
What did they stop watching?

244
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.650
What exercises are they using?

245
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.910
What have they been focused on?

246
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.290
The outer circle shows what
the exercises they were focused on.

247
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.200
The inner circle shows
the videos they're focused on.

248
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.755
And the data gets pretty granular,

249
00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:15.680
so you can actually see the exact problems
that the student got right or wrong.

250
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.670
Red is wrong, blue is right.

251
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.470
The left most question is the first
question that the student attempted.

252
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.870
They watched the video right over there.

253
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.100
And then you could see eventually,
they were able to get ten in a row.

254
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.130
It's almost like you can almost see them
learning over those last ten problems.

255
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.090
They also got faster.

256
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.690
The height is how long it took them.

257
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.140
So, when you talk about
self-paced learning,

258
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.810
it makes sense for everyone in education
speak differentiated learning, but

259
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.410
it's kind of crazy what happens when
you actually see it in a classroom.

260
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.334
Because every time we've done this in
every class room over and over again,

261
00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:52.316
if you go five days into it, there's
a group of kids who have raced ahead, and

262
00:13:52.316 --> 00:13:55.047
there's a group of kids who
are a little bit slower.

263
00:13:55.047 --> 00:13:58.185
And in a traditional model, if you do
the snapshot assessment, you say oh,

264
00:13:58.185 --> 00:14:00.350
these are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.

265
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.933
Maybe we should be tracked differently,

266
00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:04.520
maybe we should put them
in different classes.

267
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.751
But when you let every student work at
their own pace, and we see it over and

268
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:08.700
over and over again.

269
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.924
You see students who took a little bit
extra time on one concept or the other,

270
00:14:12.924 --> 00:14:16.800
but once they get through that
concept they just race ahead.

271
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.761
And so the same kids you thought
were slow, six weeks ago,

272
00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:21.400
you now would think are gifted.

273
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.780
And we’re seeing it over and
over and over again, and

274
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.960
it makes you really wonder,
kind of how much all of the labels,

275
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.449
maybe us have benefited from, were really
just due to a coincidence of time.

276
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.074
Now, as valuable as something like
this is in a district like Los Altos,

277
00:14:39.074 --> 00:14:43.111
our goal is to use technology to humanize,
not just in Los Altos, but

278
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:47.090
kind of on a global scale,
what's happening in education.

279
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.850
Actually, that kind of rings an
interesting point that a lot of the effort

280
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.430
in humanizing the classroom is
focused on student to teacher rations.

281
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.930
In our mind the relevant metric
is student to valuable human time

282
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.520
with the teacher ration.

283
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.710
So in a traditional model, most of the
teachers time is spent doing lectures, and

284
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.532
grading test, and what not.

285
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.940
Maybe 5% of their time is actually
sitting next to students, and

286
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.530
actually working with them.

287
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.590
Now, 100% of their time is.

288
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.920
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom.

289
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.820
You're humanizing the classroom,
I'd argue, by a factor of five or ten.

290
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.400
And as valuable as it is in Los Altos,

291
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.100
imagine what that does to the adult
learner who's embarrassed to go back and

292
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.060
learn stuff that they should have
known before going back to college.

293
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:36.120
Imagine what it does to a street
kid in Calcutta who has to help

294
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.280
his family during the day, and that's the
reason why he or she can't go to school.

295
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.448
Now, they can spend two hours a day and
remediate, or get up to speed and

296
00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:47.730
not feel embarrassed about what they do or
don't know.

297
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:52.294
Now, imagine what happens where,
we talked about the peers teaching each

298
00:15:52.294 --> 00:15:55.781
other inside of a classroom,
but this is all one system.

299
00:15:55.781 --> 00:16:00.416
There's no reason why you can't have that
peer to peer tutoring beyond that one

300
00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:01.188
classroom.

301
00:16:01.188 --> 00:16:06.178
Imagine what happens if that student in
Calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your

302
00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:09.348
son, or
your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta.

303
00:16:09.348 --> 00:16:14.193
And I think what you'll see
emerging is this notion of

304
00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:17.000
a global one world classroom.

305
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.808
And that's essentially what
we're trying to build.

306
00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:23.075
Thank you.

307
00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:31.750
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Awesome.

308
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.905
Very good talking to you [INAUDIBLE].

309
00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:34.533
>> Oh, okay.

310
00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:44.533
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> [APPLAUSE]

311
00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.059
>> Okay.

312
00:16:55.059 --> 00:17:04.358
>> [APPLAUSE]

313
00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:06.350
>> I've seen some things you're doing

314
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.060
in the system that have to do
with motivation and feedback.

315
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.460
>> Energy points, merit badges.

316
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.600
Tell me what you're thinking there?

317
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.340
>> Oh, yeah, no.

318
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.900
We have an awesome team working on it.

319
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.150
It's not, and I have to be clear,
it's not just me anymore.

320
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.590
I'm still doing all the videos.

321
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.260
We have a kind of a rock star
team doing the software.

322
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.790
Yeah, we've put a bunch of game mechanics
in there, where you get these badges,

323
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.020
we're gonna start having leader
boards by areas, and you get points.

324
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.790
It's actually been pretty interesting
>> Just the wording of the badging, or

325
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.120
how many points you get for doing
something, we see on a system wide basis.

326
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.820
Like tens of thousands of fifth graders or
sixth graders going one direction or

327
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.110
another depending on
what badge you give them.

328
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.880
[LAUGH]
>> And

329
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.780
the collaboration you're doing with
Los Altos, how did that come about?

330
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.560
>> Yeah, no, Los Altos has been kind of,
it was kind of crazy.

331
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.580
Once again, I didn't expect
it to be used in classrooms.

332
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.490
Someone from their board came and said,

333
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.160
oh what would you do if you had
carte blanche in a classroom?

334
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.770
And I said, well you know,

335
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.200
I would just, every student work at
their own pace on something like this,

336
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.720
we'd give a dashboard, and you know,
they said oh, this is kind of radical.

337
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.040
We have to think about it.

338
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.990
And me and the rest of the team,
like oh, you know,

339
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.880
they're never gonna want to do this.

340
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.625
But, literally the next day they were
like, can you start in two weeks?

341
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:17.810
[LAUGH]
>> So it's this fifth grade math,

342
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.160
that's going on right now?

343
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.690
>> It's two fifth grade classes and

344
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.720
two seventh grade classes, and I think
they're doing it at the district level and

345
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.840
I think what they're excited about is
>> They can now follow these kids.

346
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.090
It's not an only in school thing.

347
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.770
On Christmas we saw some
of the kids were doing.

348
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.730
and we can track everything.

349
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.870
So it can actually track them as they
go through the entire district through

350
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.000
the summer as they go from
one teacher to the next.

351
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.160
You have this continuity of data that
even at the district level they can see.

352
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.540
>> So some of those views we saw were for

353
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.670
the teacher to go in and track actually
what's going on with those kids?

354
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.080
So you're giving feedback on those teacher
views to see what they think they need?

355
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.170
>> Oh, yeah.
Actually,

356
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.680
most of those were kind
of specs by the teachers.

357
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.320
We made some of those for students so
they could see their data, but

358
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.900
we have a very tight design loop
with the teachers themselves and

359
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.520
they're literally saying, hey,
you know, this is nice but.

360
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.890
Like that focus graph, a lot of the
teachers said I have a feeling that a lot

361
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.380
of the kids are jumping around and
not focusing on one topic, so

362
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.510
we made that focus
>> A diagram for them.

363
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.600
So it's all been teacher-driven,
it's been pretty crazy.

364
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.940
>> Is this ready for prime time?

365
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:24.138
Do you think a lot of classes next
school year should try this thing out?

366
00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:27.505
>> Yeah, it's ready, we got a million
people on the site already so

367
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.200
we can handle a few more.

368
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.310
And it's a [LAUGH] It's,

369
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:36.240
no reason why it really can't happen
in every classroom in America tomorrow.

370
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.650
>> And the vision of the tutoring thing.

371
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.530
The idea there is,
if I'm confused about a topic,

372
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.780
somehow right in user interface,
I'd find people who are volunteering,

373
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.860
maybe see their reputation and I could
schedule and connect up with those people.

374
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.580
>> Absolutely.

375
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.330
And, this is something I recommend
everyone in this audience to do is, you

376
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.770
can, those dashboards that teachers have,
you can go log in right now and you could

377
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.340
get, you could essentially, become a coach
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins.

378
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.660
Or, maybe some kids at the Boys and
Girls Club.

379
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.740
And yeah, you can start becoming a mentor,
or a tutor really immediately.

380
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.486
Yeah.
Hey, it's all there.

381
00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:11.942
Well, it's amazing.

382
00:20:11.942 --> 00:20:15.401
I think you've just got a glimpse
of the future of education.

383
00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:16.204
Thank you.

384
00:20:16.204 --> 00:20:18.896
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Thank you.

385
00:20:18.896 --> 00:20:20.580
>> [APPLAUSE]

386
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:27.240
>> [MUSIC].
