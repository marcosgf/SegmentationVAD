00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:05.355
I got my start in software working on
Shrek actually, a long, long time ago.

2
00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.652
And you're taking these basic building
blocks, loops and counters and

3
00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:14.511
algorithms and you use that stuff every
single day, and you gradually build it all

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:18.034
up and it just turns into this
tool that an artist can take and

5
00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.069
then just run with it and just do
really amazing same things with it.

6
00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.980
Hi, there!

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.825
So, you did your squares, good job.

8
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.749
We're gonna make it a little
bit easier this time.

9
00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.025
We're gonna do the same squares,

10
00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:30.940
only we're going to use
something called a counter loop.

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.930
A counter loop is just
like a regular loop, but

12
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.180
every time you loop around,
you add a little bit of the number.

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.260
So, you see your counter loop right here,
it came from the loop section, and

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
then you've got your draw square function
that you've been using all along.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.445
So now,
we'll just go into the variable section.

16
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.500
You pull out that counter block and
stick it into the length bin.

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.960
So now what you've got something
that says count with counter.

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.260
From 50 to 90 using 10, draw square.

19
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.659
So what's that gonna do is it's
gonna first draw a square sides 50.

20
00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.943
Then it will add 10 to the counter, draw
it again, and then as it loops around it

21
00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:09.925
adds 10 each time so
you get squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.

22
00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:12.334
So your zombie's gonna be a master artist.

23
00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:13.030
Good job.
