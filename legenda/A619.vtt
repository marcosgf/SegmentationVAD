People make decisions every day.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.110
For example, before you go outside you
kind of have an if statement that says,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.180
if it's raining,
then I need to get my jacket.

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.380
And computers are amazing once you
decide those kinds of statements

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.900
that they can reliably execute
those things at unbelievable speed.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.550
And so a computer program, really,
is a little bit of math and

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.880
some if statements where
the decision gets made.

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.905
So in this puzzle, the if block
helps the zombie make a decision.

9
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.130
>> Brains.
>> It shuts something.

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.880
For example, let's use the block that
says If there's a path to the left and

11
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.700
put a turn left command inside it.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.850
So we're telling the zombie
to check it's surrounding.

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.760
See if there's that path on the left and
if so make that turn.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.810
And then we use the move forward
block inside this repeat

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.029
to get it to keep moving forward as
long as it just wants to go straight.

16
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.330
Then when there's the turn,

17
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.460
the if block will tell it to
make this turn to the left.

18
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.780
And you can see, if we do that,
if we're taking the turn to the left and

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.490
otherwise moving forward,
we'll achieve our goal.

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.860
So it's an example of
using an if statement,

21
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.890
which is really a fundamental
concept in computer programming.

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.580
One of the first things I learned was how
to write a program to play Tic-tac-toe.

23
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.670
So I had if statements to say okay if the
other person is about to win go ahead and

24
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.140
block that spot.

25
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.977
So have fun learning how to use if
statements, it's a key concept.
