00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.660
What do you want to be
when you grow up Olivia?

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.720
>> An astronaut.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.480
>> Do you happen to know what
a computer programmer is?

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.710
>> Yeah, no.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.680
>> Wait, what?

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.140
I'm not really sure how to explain it.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810
>> Computer programming is pretty simple.

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.880
It's a set of instructions like a recipe.

9
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.070
You have to follow them step-by-step
to get the end result you want.

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.850
>> What computer science is,
is that it's a way to impact the world.

11
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.110
>> It can be music videos,
it can be games.

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.460
>> Detect whether or
not someone's related to someone else.

13
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.440
You can find people's friends.

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
You can do all sorts of other crazy
things, like actually save lives.

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.960
>> You do have to have a drive, I think.

16
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.840
It is, to me, like a paintbrush.

17
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.318
I think great programming is not
all that dissimilar from great art.

18
00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:55.148
>> When I finally learned
a little bit of programming,

19
00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:58.200
that blank wall resolved
into a bunch of doors.

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.012
And you open them, and of course,

21
00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:03.980
the thing you find behind them is another
hallway filled with a bunch of doors.

22
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.090
>> Programming is fun and easy.

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990
You can do anything your mind wants to do.

24
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.490
>> Finally, you start to open enough
doors that the light comes in.

25
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.730
And to me, a finished program is
like a structure filled with light.

26
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.000
All the corners are illuminated.

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.720
>> The number of people
that you can touch and

28
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.530
interact with, is something
the world has never seen before.

29
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.150
>> Our first lesson in this series,
is all about what computer science is,

30
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.350
what a computer scientist does, and

31
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.550
how you can be more responsible
in your use of technology.

32
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.910
It's a very important lesson,
but it is a little text heavy.

33
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.953
But at the end,

34
00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:46.783
you get to make your very own customized
encoding using your initials.

35
00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:49.275
It's a fun activity and
it's very empowering,

36
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.618
because binary is one of those
things that feels very technical,

37
00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:56.163
but once you understand it,
it's like you speak a secret language.

38
00:01:56.163 --> 00:02:04.849
