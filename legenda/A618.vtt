00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
Every athlete knows that
you get good by practicing.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.160
By repeating the same moves until you get
really good or until you reach your goal.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.490
When I was in high school,

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.190
I wouldn't leave practice until
I made ten freethrows in a row.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.710
Similarly, when you get
to a computer program and

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.950
repeat a command, you can give it
an exact number of times to repeat.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.530
Or you can define a goal and

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.900
tell it to repeat the command
until it reaches some goal.

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.570
In the next example,
the repeat block is changed.

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.590
Instead of specifying how many
times you want it to repeat,

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.020
you can use the repeat until block to
tell the angry bird to do the same thing.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.430
Until it gets the pig or
until it crashes into the wall.

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.320
And again, we can put multiple
blocks inside the loop and

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.670
repeat a series of actions.
